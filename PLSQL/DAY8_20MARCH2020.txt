What is a cursor in Oracle Databasse?

1. Cursor is a pointer to a memory area called context area.
2. This context area is a memory region inside the Process Global Area or PGA.
3. Assigned to hold the information about the processing of a SELECT statement or DML Statement


What is a Context area?

Context area is a memory region inside the PGA which help oracle server in procession an SQL statement by holding the important information about that statemtnt.

These information includes
1. Rows returned by a query.
2. Number or rows processed by a query.
3. A pointer to the parsed query in the shared pool.

Using coursor you can control the context area as it is a pointer to the same.


Types of cursors in Oracle Database-
1. Implicit Cursors
2. Explicit Cursors


Implicit Cursors in Oracle Database-

1. As the name suggest these are the cursors which are 'Automatically created by the oracle server' every time and SQL DML statement is executed.
2. User cannot control the behavior of these cursors.

Oracle server creates an implicit cursor for any PL/SQL block which executes an SQL statement.
As long as an explicit cursor does not exists for the SQL statement.



Explicit Cursors in Oracle Database-

1. In contrast implicit cursors we have Explicit cursors.
2. 'Explicit cursors are user defined cursors' (which means user has to create these cursors for any statement which return more than one row of data)
3. Unlike implicit cursor 'User has full control of explicit cursor'.



Steps for creating an Explicit Cursor--
To create an Explicit Cursor we need to follow four steps. These four steps are-
1. Declare
2. Open
3. Fetch
4. Close

In case of implicit cursors, oracle performs all these steps automatically for us.


Declare-
1. Declaring a cursor means initializing a cursor into memory.
2. You define explicit cursor in declaration section of your PL/SQL block.

Syntax of Declaring a cursor-

CURSOR cursor_name IS select_statement;

Declaration starts with keyword CURSOR followed by the cursor_name which could be anything we want, then we have another keyword IS which is followed by a valid select_statement.

After the select statement we have to Opent the cursor.


Open-
1. In order to put that cursor to work we have to open it first.
2. When you open a cursor the memory will be allotted to it.
  











declare
cursor c is select deptno, dname from dept;
cursor c1(v_no number) is select name from emp where deptno=v_dno;
begin 
open c;
loop
fetch c into v_dno, v_dname;
exit when c%notfound;
dbms_output.put_line(v_dno||','||v_name);
open c1(v_dno);
loop
fetch c1 into
