What top level business wants...

1. Data should be integrated across the enterprise
2. Summary data has a real value to the organization
3. Historical data holds the key to understanding data over time
4. What-if capabilities are required
5. What will happen? (Predective Analytics-Machine Learning)


Evolution of reporting 

1. 60's Batch reports
* hard to find and analyze information
* inflexible and expensive, reprogram every new request

2. 70's Terminal-based DSS and EIS (executive information systems)

3. 80's Desktop data access and analysis tools 
* query tools, spreadsheets, GUIs
* easier to use, but only access operational databases

4. 90's Data warehousing with integrated OLAP engines and tools 

5. Now.... safe way example (Retail chain in US)
