SCD scenario to solve. Require the below mentioned tasks to be done.

1.	Design customer table to hold customer SCD 1 data.

2.	Write a code which loads your customer SCD 1 table considering all the tables mentioned in the attached pic as the source tables.
  
  Customer_name is only mentioned as name here but please ensure to split them as first, middle and last name in your target table.

  Please send in the create table scripts as well along with your codes for testing. The same concept of what was discussed in SCD 1 is to be implemented here. Insert as an insert and update as an update. Would want to see this code by EOD today.


CREATE TABLE country
(
ctry_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
ctry_name VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL,
);


CREATE TABLE region
(
reg_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
reg_name VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL,
ctry_id REFERENCES country(ctry_id)
);

CREATE TABLE state
(
state_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
state_name VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL,

);

CREATE TABLE city
(

INSERT ALL
INTO country VALUES(1,'INDIA')
INTO country VALUES(1,'INDIA')
INTO country VALUES(1,'INDIA')
INTO country VALUES(1,'INDIA')
SELECT * FROM DUAL;
