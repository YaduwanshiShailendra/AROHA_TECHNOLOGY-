PL/SQL Question---

Some scalar data types such as NUMBER, VARCHAR2, DATE, CHAR, LONG, BOOLEAN. Some composite data type such as RECORD & TABLE.

6. What are % TYPE and % ROWTYPE? What are the advantage of using these over data types?
% TYPE provides the data type of a varible or a database column to that variable.
% ROWTYPE provides the record type that represents a entire row of a table or view or columns selected in the cursor.

The advantages are: 
1. need not know about variable's data type 
2. If the database definition of a column in a table changes, the data type of a variable changes accordingly.

7. What is difference between % ROWTYPE and TYPE RECORD?
% ROWTYPE is to be used whenever query returns a entire row of a table or view.
TYPE rec RECORD is to be used whernever query returns columns of different table or views and variables.

E.g. TYPE r_emp is RECORD (eno emp.empno% type, ename emp ename % type);
Cursor c1 is select empno, deptno form emp;
e_rec c1 %ROWTYPE.

8. What is PL/SQL table?
Objects of type TABLE are called "PL/SQL tables", which are modelled as (but not the same as) database tables, PL/SQL
